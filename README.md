These files are based on https://github.com/Andrik45719/ZY-M100 Sensor patching, to make the Sensors less spammy. 
These are patched to silence DP 104 ("none or exist", currently not even handled by home assistant) and DP 255 which is also not handled by HA.
One of the 2 mods also silences the illuminance packets, in case you don't need them.
Please refer to Andrik45719's Github for instructions on howo to flash.

A Big thank you to Andrik45719 for his work!!
